A Javascript-based generator of laser cutter friendly etchable rulers
### Features
*  **SVG** Genrates fully vector based rulers ready for laser-etching, printing, plotting, or CAD applications
* Similar lines are labeled and grouped when opened in Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape.
* Uses [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) for drawing and export
* I referenced the [excellent SVG export example here](http://paperjs.org/features/#svg-import-and-export)
